# Video Toolbox
## _Automatic video analysis_

## Requirements
- OpenCV >= `4.x.x` compiled for CUDA and cuDNN parallel computing (`4.4.0` was used)
- CUDA >= `10.x`

## Caveat Lector
The following repository includes a set of operations for basic video analysis. I mainly used it to deal with C++ and CUDA hardware acceleration. All the files that were meant to set up a full development environment and provide an easy-to-use tool were deleted.
